This repository contains a notebook which offers a quick practical guide, to illustrate how to estimate a count data regression model using four different variants: Poisson, Zero-inflated Poisson, Negative Binomial and Zero-inflated Negative Binomial models. It is not supposed to be a comprehensive guide but it is an starting point if you don't know what R packages and how relevant functions can be used to estimate these models.
